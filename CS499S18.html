                            <p>The technology to be developed must be able to adapt to changing functional needs. Modularity is paramount, and therefore is to be emphasized throughout the entirety of the project lifecycle. Once software development is completed, the user should only be responsible for adding or removing parts from the robot, allowing the robot to gain or modify its functionality to meet a new need.</p>
                            <p>The goal for this project is to develop the robot to fit a single use case and developing differing functions to accomplish this use case to meet modularity requirements.</p>

Many systems can be modeled as networks of interconnected queues, from emergency rooms to communication in computer networks. It is, however, nontrivial to find optimal configurations for these systems, given factors such as cost and throughput. This project seeks to solve this optimization problem in a way that can be applied to many different fields.</div>

However, the old prototype was hastily made to meet a short deadline and is, therefore, full of software-breaking bugs. The challenge for the ITSS engineering team is to redesign this platform from the ground up. As we develop the platform, we will create intuitive user design dealing with site navigation, form input and validation, and multiple open-ended data visualizations. With a longer timespan and a dedicated team developing the new platform, we expect the project to be finished in the late spring of 2018.ipsun</div>

It is a type of virtual reality that immerses the user by creating a unique experience. Unlike traditional virtual reality, the CAVE is a room typically made up of projection screens that make the user feel as if they are actually in the virtual reality. What sets the CAVE apart from other types of virtual reality is that with the CAVE, the user actually has a sense of spatial awareness, and multiple people can be inside the CAVE at once. Our goal is to create a cost effective CAVE for the university, since traditional CAVE systems tend to be very expensive.</div>

                            The problem at hand is that the way in which DxR Development Group currently handles the creation of
                            instances of their Clinician software for customers is slow and involved. It requires not only that an
                            employee make the sale, but also an IT member manually go into their server and run the creation scripts
                            manually. They want to be able to get the Clinician instance up immediately and with no additional
                            personal overhead. Our goal with this project is to create a web based application that will allow DxR employees to quickly
                            and easily create and manage Clinician instances.

                    we make every reasonable attempt to accommodate you.
                    However, it is your responsibility to discuss this with the instructor at the beginning of the

                <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
                <p>Work in this course, unless explicitly stated in writing to the contrary, is to be an effort by the
                    individual student. It is not acceptable to use work other than your own without full attribution
                    and acknowledgment. While you are welcome to discuss problems with others, it is not acceptable to
                    discuss solutions with them.
                    Depending on the severity of the infraction, penalties may include a grade of zero on the offending
                    item, a grade of zero on the offending item and a reduction of the final grade by one full letter
                    grade, a failing grade in the course with an indication of academic dishonesty. Such penalties might
                    result in a requirement to withdraw from the university.
                    If in doubt about anything related to academic integrity, see the instructor.
