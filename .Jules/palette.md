## 2026-01-31 - Missing Skip-to-Content Link
**Learning:** The "Skip to content" link is a critical accessibility feature often missed in initial setup, even when other a11y features like ARIA labels are present. Its absence forces keyboard users to navigate through repetitive navigation headers (like large social/nav bars) on every page load.
**Action:** Always check `layout.tsx` (or equivalent root component) first for a skip link. If missing, adding one is a high-impact, low-effort win that immediately benefits keyboard and screen reader users. Ensure the target (e.g., `<main>`) has `id` and `tabIndex={-1}` for proper focus management.
