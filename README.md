- `Software.tsx`

## Deployment

This site is configured for deployment on **Azure Static Web Apps** via GitHub Actions.

On every push to the `master` branch, the site automatically:
1. Builds the Next.js static export
2. Deploys to Azure Static Web Apps

See `.github/workflows/` for the deployment configuration.

## Publication filters and validation

Publication searches can be shared using the `q`, `type`, `themes`, and `count` URL parameters. Selected themes use AND matching. Preprints have their own classification and filter; arXiv paper-page and PDF links are distinguished automatically. The optional BibTeX `pdf` field can supply a direct PDF separately from a paper's `url`.

Run `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`. Production builds automatically run `check:links`, which checks local files and anchors in the exported HTML and the full bibliography, including publications hidden by pagination. Broken local references fail the build. External destinations are not comprehensively crawled.

The current scope and verification notes are saved in [the improvement plan](docs/homepage-improvements.md).
